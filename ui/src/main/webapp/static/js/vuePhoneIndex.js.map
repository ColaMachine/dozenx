等分的原则进行划分。\r\n划分之后的信息区块我们称之为『盒子』。建议横向排列的盒子数量最多四个，最少一个。『盒子』在整个屏幕上占比见上图。设计部分基于盒子的单位定制盒子内部的排版规则，以保证视觉层面的舒适感。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>布局的栅格化系统，我们是基于行（row）和列（col）来定义信息区块的外部框架，以保证页面的每个区域能够稳健地排布起来。下面简单介绍一下它的工作原理：\r\n   通过row在水平方向建立一组column（简写col）\r\n   你的内容应当放置于col内，并且，只有col可以作为row的直接元素\r\n   栅格系统中的列是指1到24的值来表示其跨越的范围。例如，三个等宽的列可以使用.col-8来创建\r\n   如果一个row中的col总和超过 24，那么多余的col会作为一个整体另起一行排列</p>\r\n<h3>代码演示<zwIcon

48px。\r\n顶部导航（展示类页面）：一级导航高度 80px，二级导航 56px。\r\n顶部导航高度的范围计算公式为：48+8n。\r\n侧边导航宽度的范围计算公式：200+8n。\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>交互</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n一级导航和末级的导航需要在可视化的层面被强调出来；\r\n当前项应该在呈现上优先级最高；\r\n当导航收起的时候，当前项的样式自动赋予给它的上一个层级；\r\n左侧导航栏的收放交互同时支持手风琴和全展开的样式，根据业务的要求进行适当的选择。\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>视觉</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n导航样式上需要根据信息层级合理的选择样式：\r\n大色块强调\r\n建议用于底色为深色系时，当前页面父级的导航项。\r\n高亮火柴棍\r\n当导航栏底色为浅色系时使用，可用于当前页面对应导航项，建议尽量在导航路径的最终项使用。\r\n字体高亮变色\r\n从可视化层面，字体高亮的视觉强化力度低于大色块，通常在当前项的上一级使用。\r\n字体放大\r\n12px、14px 是导航的标准字号，14 号字体用在一、二级导航中。字号可以考虑导航项的等级做相应选择。\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>组件概述</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nLayout：布局容器，其下可嵌套 Header Sider Content Footer 或 Layout 本身，可以放在任何父容器中。\r\nHeader：顶部布局，自带默认样式，其下可嵌套任何元素，只能放在 Layout 中。\r\nSider：侧边栏，自带默认样式及基本功能，其下可嵌套任何元素，只能放在 Layout 中。\r\nContent：内容部分，自带默认样式，其下可嵌套任何元素，只能放在 Layout 中。\r\nFooter：底部布局，自带默认样式，其下可嵌套任何元素，只能放在 Layout 中。\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>代码演示<zwIcon type=\"windows\"

12 栅格系统的基础上，我们将整个设计建议区域按照 24 等分的原则进行划分。\\r\\n划分之后的信息区块我们称之为『盒子』。建议横向排列的盒子数量最多四个，最少一个。『盒子』在整个屏幕上占比见上图。设计部分基于盒子的单位定制盒子内部的排版规则，以保证视觉层面的舒适感。\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>布局的栅格化系统，我们是基于行（row）和列（col）来定义信息区块的外部框架，以保证页面的每个区域能够稳健地排布起来。下面简单介绍一下它的工作原理：\\r\\n   通过row在水平方向建立一组column（简写col）\\r\\n   你的内容应当放置于col内，并且，只有col可以作为row的直接元素\\r\\n   栅格系统中的列是指1到24的值来表示其跨越的范围。例如，三个等宽的列可以使用.col-8来创建\\r\\n   如果一个row中的col总和超过 24，那么多余的col会作为一个整体另起一行排列</p>\\r\\n<h3>代码演示<zwIcon type=\\\"windows\\\" title=\\\"展开全部代码\\\"></zwIcon></h3>\\r\\n<zwRow >\\r\\n<zwCol span=24>\\r\\n    <zwBox class=\\\"\\\">\\r\\n        <div
